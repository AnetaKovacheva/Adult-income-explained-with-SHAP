# Adult-income-explained-with-SHAP

This Notebook explores and models Adult income data. It is used for predicting as to if a person's income would exceed $50 000 per year, or not.

The work follows the regular supervised Machine Learning approach: load, explore, and clean data; data modelling, prediction, evaluate model performance, and interpretation. I use RandomForestClassifier() and XGBoostClassifier() to predict labels, and SHAP - to explain importance and impact of each feature for model output.

The focus of this work is not on EDA or modelling, but on SHAP framework and on explaining Machine Learning models.
